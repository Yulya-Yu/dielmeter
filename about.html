				<h3>about Di-El meter</h3>
				<p>I propose methods for control of the electrical characteristics of non-metallic and semiconducting materials (1. Yushkov V. N. Methods for measuring of physical characteristics of laminated structural systems using open waveguide structure. Izvestiya VUZ, physics, 1980, № 10; 2. Yushkov V.N. The use of impedance models in the problems of dielectrics control. Izvestiya VUZ, physics, № 5, 1984) Published in Russian: Юшков В.Н. Методы измерения физических характеристик слоистых структур с применением открытой волноводной структуры. Известия ВУЗ, Физика, № 10,1980 г.; Юшков В.Н. Применение импедансных моделей в задачах контроля диэлектриков. Известия ВУЗ, Физика, № 5, 1984 г.</p>
				<p>Therefrom, Yushkov Valentin has designed the numbers of contactless, radio wave devices with one-way approach to the surface of nondestructive testing of physical and mechanical characteristics of non-metallic materials and products. Such as device Emiksi-1 (electromagnetic quality indicator for construction products, which is intended to measure the dielectric permittivity and detect dissimilarities in non-metallic materials). With the help of this device the correlation of the concrete strength and its dielectric permittivity were discovered for the first time.</p>

						<h3>usage</h3>
						<p>Device Emiksi-1 can be used to control the distribution of solidity of concrete in the concrete products and location of reinforcing steel and hollows in these products. It also can be used to control the roadway covering in motion. The results of developing of monitoring method, control means and its applications were published in 19 printed articles. The Emiksi and Zond 1 devices were exhibited at various exhibitions.</p>

						<h3>structure of the devise</h3>
						<p>Structurally, the devices consist of a compact measuring unit and remote sensor (transducer). One of the modifications of Emiksi was tested in order to observe the dynamics of changes in the electrophysical properties of hardening concrete mix,
							which was prepared in a steam-heat warming mode. For this purpose, the sensor was installed in the slot of one of the sections of the cartridge unit, which was designed to manufacture concrete products in steam treatment mode. The working surface
						of the sensor was separated from the concrete mix with radio parent partition.</p>

						<h3>test results</h3>
						<p>It is possible to locate hidden laydowns in the roadbed, to control the conditinon of the roadbad from any vehicle moving on the high speed.</p>

						<h3>current state</h3>
						<p>Currently, it is impossible to bring these results into industrial application due to the <span>lack of funding</span>. Given the funding, it is expected to expand the informational content of the characteristics, which are measured by the control
							devices. Moreover, it is expected to replace the components and materials, which are used in the existing prototypes of the control devices, to the modern ones. It is also necessary to develop the technology of the device production and to create
						new prototypes of the control devices.</p>
